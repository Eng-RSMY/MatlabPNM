# MatlabPNM
Pore Network Modeling immiscible two phase code written in Matlab.

#What is MatlabPNM?

MatlabPNM is an open-source framework for performing pore network modeling simulations of multiphase transport in porous materials. It includes modules for generating various common network topologies, pore and throat geometry models, pore scale physics models, and fluid property estimation. It also contains a growing set of algorithms for running various simulations such drainage and Imbibition curves, permeability, and more.

MatlabPNM is written in Matlab. My goal is to help other scientists and engineers harness the power and intuitive pore network modeling approach, so if you are interested in this package, please contact me through Github, or email me directly.
