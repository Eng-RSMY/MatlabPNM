# MatlabPNM
A Matlab-based package for performing Pore Network Modeling of porous media.

#What is MatlabPNM?

MatlabPNM is an open-source framework for performing pore network modeling simulations of multiphase transport in porous materials. It includes modules for generating various common network topologies, pore and throat geometry models, pore scale physics models, and fluid property estimation. It also contains a growing set of algorithms for running various simulations such drainage and Imbibition curves, permeability, and more.

MatlabPNM is written in Matlab. My goal is to help other scientists and engineers harness the power and intuitive pore network modeling approach, so if you are interested in this package, please contact me through Github, or email me directly.

#Usage

To run the codes, start with the InputData.m file after specifying the required quantities. The Network will be constructed by NetworkConstruction.m file and then the primary drainage and secondary imbibition will be run by PrimaryDrainage.m and SecondaryImbibition.m, respectively, which are all in SourceCode folder.

#Contribute
I welcome collaboration with other investigators studying Pore Scale Modeling. Please contact us if you are interested in expanding the code or find bugs to correct. I can also provide limited support (on a case-by-case basis) or consulting servies.
